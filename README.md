# Linear_Equations_Solver
### This is a console program to solve linear equation systems. It uses command line parameters to read from/save to file.
### Example: 
#### -in in.txt -out out.txt
#### Program reads in inputs from the file in.txt and saves solutions to the file out.txt.

### In order to use the program, user needs to fill in the input file in the following way:
